  <p>My name is Magdiel Fernandez and i am an aspiring graphic designer.I am 19 years old and I am a Miami Native.<br>
     I am a second year student at the Miami International University of Art & Design. Graphic design for me has <br>
     always been a passion. I have always loved the idea of just creating your own thing and being able to inspire <br>
     others through your creations.</p>
